# CPU-Scheduling
Program that takes in processes and run through different CPU Scheduling Algorithms (FCFS, Round Robin, MLFQ)

Steps to run the program:
1. Compile and run CPU_Scheduling.c
2. Choose the workload provided or create a custom workload for the scheduling algorithms
3. If custom workload is chosen, enter the number of processes for the workload, the burst time and arrival time for each process
4. Choose a scheduling algorithm you wish to test the workload with
5. If Round Robin or MLFQ is selected, a time quantum is required to run the algorithm
6. The waiting time and average turnaround time for each process, together with the average waiting time, average turnaround time and          throughput of the workload will be printed on screen
